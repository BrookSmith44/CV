          <br>
          <p>Other than spending time on my computer I love the great outdoors and most sport. My passion is
            in FOOTBALL whether watching and supporting LFC or playing myself. I have throughout my life
            been involved with football in one form or another. I have played competitive football from the age
            of 6 playing for our village team for four years and going on to play senior football for my school and
            local teams. I continue to play football for a local village team where I won the 'Bishops Cult Hero'
            award in my first season.</p>
            <br>
          <p>Encouraged by my “go for it parents” I have tried aggressive skating, water skiing, climbing and off-
            road cycling and more recently a motorbike.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Developed an interest in programming and web development at the age of 17 during that year
            began teaching myself at home and using my own personal computer to create games and produce
            web applications. I am self taught but found an aptitude for it and fell in love with the nature of the work. I
            was lucky enough to be given an opportunity to take some work experience in a marketing company
            specialising in web development and creation of programs and found myself to be well within my

            capabilities and enjoyed the experience, the challenge and the work. As a result I opted for a
            computer course at University. I consider it a hobby and hope that it will become my career.</p>
