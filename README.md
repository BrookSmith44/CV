##Design
###Index page

The index page will have a basic design in which there will be a header with links to the _cv.hmtl, bio.html, contact.html_ and _a gallery page_. The header will also have my personal logo in the centre with two the links on either side of the logo. The background image will be one from a photo I have already taken to make it more personal to me and help avoid copyright .

The header links will have hover effects so the employers know that they are links using a colour a colour basic colour scheme of green and black. 

There will be text in the middle of the screen with my name and what I am currently doing.

##Began coding _index.html_

To begin I wanted to code the layout of the page so that I could have a base to in which I would experiment with the code until it looks good.

Then started making the button links in the header which will lead to _contact.html, bio.html, cv.html_ and _gallery.htm_. They were designed to only have a  bottom border and no background colour so that when a hover effect is included it will look like the colour is leaking out of the border.

##Finishing the _index.html_ page for desktop
Finished the _index.html_ page by adding a link to the logo so that it links back to _index.html_ as the header will be consistent throughout the entire website it will always be a way to get back to this page. Also added box shadow to the header so it appears that the header is hovering above the main. 

I also added my name and current occupation in the main with a transparent background and solid border.

Put email and copyright in the footer.

##Responsive _index.html_
Changed a lot of the css so that percentages were used more in order to make the page more responsive to to the page size. Changed the background image due to wanting something more colourful that stands out.
Added image of myself to the main, however making the image responsive proved to be difficult as changing the dimensions meant the image gets distorted so I will have to use media query to adjust the layout for mobile.

Added icons to the footer that show contact details when hovered over and two of them are links to social media accounts, these also proved difficult to make responsive so a media query may also have to be used in order to make them more responsive.

##Design
###CV page
The _CV.html_ page will have the same header and footer of the _index.html_ as will all the pages. The page will be split into four section, Qualifications, Experience, Skills and Hobbies.

##_CV.html_

Changed the layout of the _cv.html_ compared to the way it was designed. Took out hobbies and decided to have Qualifications on the left by itself as it contains a large amount of content whereas experience and skills has considerable less. Also changed the links at the top.
