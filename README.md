##Design
###Index page

The index page will have a basic design in which there will be a header with links to the _cv.hmtl, bio.html, contact.html_ and _a gallery page_. The header will also have my personal logo in the centre with two the links on either side of the logo. The background image will be one from a photo I have already taken to make it more personal to me and help avoid copyright .

The header links will have hover effects so the employers know that they are links using a colour a colour basic colour scheme of green and black. 

There will be text in the middle of the screen with my name and what I am currently doing.

##Began coding _index.html_

To begin I wanted to code the layout of the page so that I could have a base to in which I would experiment with the code until it looks good.

Then started making the button links in the header which will lead to _contact.html, bio.html, cv.html_ and _gallery.htm_. They were designed to only have a  bottom border and no background colour so that when a hover effect is included it will look like the colour is leaking out of the border.
